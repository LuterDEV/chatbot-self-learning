****I'M MODIFYING THE CODE UNTIL NEXT NOTICE 19-02-2024****
--------------------------------------------

Project made by https://github.com/LuterDEV

This is a simple chatbot with the objective of feeding it with questions and answers in order to give first line IT suport or FAQ in Webs


If no answer related to the question is found, it will ask you to explain what you are asking

--------------------------------------------

Create a .env file with the next variables:
replies -> The amount of answers the bot can give. I prefer to chose 1
similarity -> The percentage of similarity the question of the user with a question stored in the .json

--------------------------------------------

Create a knlowdege_db.json with this inside:
{
  "questions": [

  ]
}

--------------------------------------------

With this you have enough to start running the project by yourself! Good luck and stay curious!!
